= Usage =

Simply go to Appearance > Widgets and drag "FF Tab Widget" instance to the sidebar of your choice. Within the widget are several options where you can show/hide tab item and specifify the content limit. See the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/ff-tab-widget/screenshots" target="_blank">screenshots</a> for more details.

= Tabs Widget Style =

The tab widget style tested on "Twenty Twelve" theme (see the plugin screenshot). It may look different on other themes. You can adjust its style by modifying CSS file (fftw.css) inside the plugin folder. To make developers easy to make modification I also profide the LESS file (fftw.less). 

If you do not have time to make your tabs widget looks beautiful on your theme, you can <a href="mailto:kharisblank@gmail.com">contact me</a> for plugin customization service.
